This repository includes the code submission for 11775 HW1.

The project consists of three parts: 1) feature extraction, 2) model training 3) model validation and testing

Part 1: feature extraction. This part is done by running 'run.feature.sh'. Output features are stored in /asr_vector and /mfcc_vector.

Part 2: model training. This part is also done by running 'run.feature.sh'. Trained models are stored in /asr_pred and /asr_pred.

Part 3: model validation and testing. This part is done by running 'run.val.sh' or 'run.med.sh'. Output predictions are saved in /asr_pred and /asr_pred.
